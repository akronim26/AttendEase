Objective:
The Web Development Team of Team NCC is a hub for tech enthusiasts passionate about creating impactful digital solutions. We’re looking for individuals eager to code, solve problems and build user-friendly platforms. Being part of the team offers opportunities to learn from the experienced seniors in the field and gain hands-on experience in production-level development. A solid understanding of web technologies, attention to detail, and a collaborative mindset are essential. While prior experience is not mandatory, it will be an advantage. Join us to code, innovate, and make a real difference!

Problem Statement:
Design and develop a basic attendance portal where users can securely log in and mark their attendance as present or absent. The admin should be able to view all submitted entries in a simple dashboard. The project should include clean frontend and backend functionalities, with a focus on usability, scalability, and responsiveness. There are no constraints on the tech stack, you have the freedom to choose tools and frameworks of your preference. Don’t feel overwhelmed by seeing the problem statements, if you find ‘em too hard, it’s always ok to submit even the incomplete versions in time, rather than not being part of the competition at all.

Ensure that the application is secure, with proper handling of sensitive data.
Follow best practices for coding, including modularity, clean code, and appropriate use of APIs.
AI assisted codes are strictly prohibited, whilst you are encouraged to make full use of AIs to learn and understand new concepts. If it appears while reviewing that any segment of your code is AI generated, your submission will not be considered.
The whole repo should be git tracked, we will judge you on the basis of the commits.
While Hosting the project is not necessary, it is a plus point if you may.
Make sure to include setup instructions in the README file.
